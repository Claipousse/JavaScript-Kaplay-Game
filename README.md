## About the Project

This repository contains a game project developed using Kaplay and Node.js. It's primarily an experimental project to try out Kaplay technology, so it's currently incomplete.  
The goal is simple, your character "kat", have a weapon to eliminate skeleton, which spawns randomly in the map.  
When a skeleton dies, he drop a coin, which you can collect.  
The game works with a wave system. The game was supposed to integrate a shop system to buy upgrade between two waves, but i'm not sure i'm going to add it.  
A lot of settings for the game (such as fire rate, range, spawn rate, ... are customable in the config.js file
